            <h2>Demilitarized Time</h2>

        <p>
            Demilitarized Time stems from the fact that the minutes, seconds,
            and milliseconds of non-militarized time don't have meridian identifiers 
            ('am' and 'pm'). The idea is that we can split these durations up into
            two halfs and use these identifiers to 'demilitarize' time. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Demilitarized Time was my first alternative time format. Here, the 
            joke is the implication of some conspiracy to militarize time. "The
            government is secretly militarizing society through time! We need to 
            resist by freeing time and using meridian identifiers everywhere!" 
            Or something to that effect. Obviously showing time in this way makes
            it much harder to interperet the actual time; comprehending 
            1pm:29pm:00pm:499pm (1:59:30:999 pm) is not exactly easy as is, 
            when the *pm*s and *am*s are constanty flipping, it becomes quite 
            hard! Demilitarized Time does add a little excitement into every 
            minute, second, and millisecond though; sometimes anticipating the 
            identifier flips can be enthralling!
